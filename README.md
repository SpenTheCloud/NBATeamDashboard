# NBATeamDashboard
This project demonstrates a DevOps approach to monitoring NBA team performance using AWS services. It showcases infrastructure as code, automated deployments, monitoring, and alerting in a cloud environment.

# NBA Team Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a serverless NBA Team Performance Dashboard using AWS services. It showcases real-time data processing, storage, and visualization of NBA team statistics, along with basic DevOps practices.

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram]
(You'll need to create and add an architecture diagram image)

## Key Components
1. **Data Source**: sportsdata.io NBA API
2. **AWS Services**:
   - S3: Stores static website files and raw data
   - DynamoDB: Stores processed team performance data
   - Lambda: Fetches and processes NBA data
   - CloudWatch: Monitors Lambda function and provides basic alerting
   - QuickSight: Visualizes team performance data (alternative: custom web app hosted on S3)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. AWS Account
2. sportsdata.io API key
3. AWS CLI installed and configured
4. GitHub account

### Deployment Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-performance-dashboard.git
   cd nba-performance-dashboard
   ```

2. Create an S3 bucket:
   ```
   aws s3 mb s3://nba-performance-dashboard-{your-unique-identifier}
   ```

3. Create a DynamoDB table:
   ```
   aws dynamodb create-table --table-name NBATeamStats --attribute-definitions AttributeName=TeamId,AttributeType=S --key-schema AttributeName=TeamId,KeyType=HASH --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
   ```

4. Deploy the Lambda function:
   (Include steps to package and deploy the Lambda function)

5. Set up the QuickSight dashboard:
   (Include steps to create a QuickSight dashboard or deploy the web app to S3)

6. Configure CloudWatch alarms:
   (Include steps to set up basic CloudWatch alarms)

## CI/CD Pipeline
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

To set up the CI/CD pipeline:
1. Add your AWS credentials to your GitHub repository's secrets.
2. Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the workflow.

## Usage
After deployment, you can access the dashboard at:
(Include the URL of your QuickSight dashboard or S3-hosted web app)

The dashboard updates automatically as new data is processed by the Lambda function.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more detailed team statistics
- Implement user authentication
- Create custom alerts based on team performance thresholds
